Description: Configures network and users on first boot of VM
  Virtualmaster package is a set of scripts to kickoff freshly installed
  virtual machine. Most of tasks are performed only once, on first boot.
  Idea of this package is to have one universal distro-independent config
  file and then set of distro-specific packages (e.g. .deb, .rpm, .tgz).
  Main tasks are:
    - set up networking (IP, gateway, nameservers) on first booot
    - set root's password
    - optionaly create users and add ssh keys
